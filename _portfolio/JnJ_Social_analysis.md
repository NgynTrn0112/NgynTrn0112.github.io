## Project Background
Johnson & Johnson (JnJ) is a global leader in healthcare industry, operating in 3 main segments-pharmaceuticals, medical services, and consumer health products. The brand is known for its long history of innovation and strong global presence. Although J&J demonstrates an active presence on various social media platforms, the strategy they employed is relatively simple and fails to capture the recent movement.
<br> This analytics project investigated the key factors influencing Facebook post engagement, focusing on variables such as posting time, content type, brand popularity, and the presence of special emotion reactions.

---

## Executive Summary
A record of 891 posts ranging from Aug-2019 to Jul-2024 displays a sharp increase in engagement during the Covid-19 periods, though the figure returned to normal post-pandemic.
<br> Posting at different period of the day can return statistically difference results.
<br> Additionally, Link post-type generally underperformed, comparing to Video & Photo post-types.

## Insight Deep-Dive

### Post Engagement
A Facebook post engagement can be measured by *Like, Comment, Share,* and *Emotional reaction*. However, as the *Like* action requires the least friction for the audience. The analysis will treat the number of *Like* as the indicator for the post performance.

</div>

Furthermore, *Like* shows positive correlation with other indexes, especially *Share*.

We will further learn how the factors drive the engagement

</div>

### Reactions
- Majority of the reactions show a positive correlation with *Like*
- The associations, however, are weak, with only *Love* has the mild correlation of 0.39

### Covid-19
- Engagement during Covid-19 was higher, indicated by higher peak and mean

- Two-sample t-test suggests a 1.5 times statistical difference between the periods.

</div>

### Posting time
- Majority of posts are published during *Night* time

</div>

- However, Tukey's test results imply a statistically significant difference between *Night* and *Morning* under 90% level of confidence
- Although Afternoon time posts seem to return better result, the scarcity in number make the findings unreliable.

### Post type
- *Video* and *Link* are the most dominant post type during Covid period, with videos slightly ahead
- The pattern persisted post-Covid, but links have overtaken vidoes, and the gap has widened significantly

</div>

- To tailor a strategy closer to reality, we filtered out the Covid-19 period
- *Photos* and *Videos* generates more engagement across all three metrics
- Tukey's test results indicate that there is statistical difference between types of post, especially photo significantly outperforms the rest

## Recommendations
- Altering time posting schedule:
  - Migrating majority of posts from *Night* time to *Morning*
  - Experimenting with *Afternoon* time and revaluating the outcomes
- Adopting new strategy to follow current trends:
  - Only posting *Photos* and *Videos*: major media platforms are speculated to restraint the organic reach of posts that include **external link**
  - Educating and entertaining are the key areas for content to thrive
