## About me
Hi! I'm Ricky from Saigon, Vietnam. A data enthusiast, an inquisitive, an advocate for decisions for decisions backed by evidence.

I am a **Distinction** Master of Business Analytics graduate from *The University of Western Australia*, where I received solid training in leveraging analytical tools and techniques to solve complex business problems. Armed with tools like **Power BI**, **Python**, and a strong coffee, I can bridge the gap between raw data and real-world decisions. Data might be my thing, but I promise I can talk about more than just KPIs.
